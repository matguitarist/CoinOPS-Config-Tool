The Virtual Console lineup consists of titles originally released on past home and handheld consoles. These titles are run in their original forms through software emulation (excluding GBA titles on 3DS), therefore remaining mostly unaltered, and can be purchased from the Wii Shop Channel or Nintendo eShop for between 500 and 1200 Wii Points
